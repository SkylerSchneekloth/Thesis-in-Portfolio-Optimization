WARNING!
A significant shortcoming of my thesis submission is the realistic modeling of portfolio turnover and transaction costs. Referencing lines 363-366 of PortfolioBacktester.R you can see that portfolio turnover is approximated rather than exact. That's because df_weights contains the "optimal" weighting scheme as a result of monthly rebalancing, as opposed to the actual MoM change in a portfolioâ€™s composition due to fluctuations in asset prices. For example, if you ran an equally-weighted portfolio though PortfolioBacktester.R transaction costs would equal zero (which is obviously incorrect). Future research will address this issue.
